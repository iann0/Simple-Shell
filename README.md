A minimal UNIX-style shell written in C.
A project i undertook to learn bits of low-level programming in C.

This simple shell contains the following :
-Command execution(`ls`, `pwd`, etc.)
- Built-in commands like `pwd`,`echo` `cd`, `exit`,`history` etc.
- Background tasks using `&` - Input / output redirection : `>`, `<`
- Single pipe support : `ls | grep.c`
- Signal handling(`Ctrl + C` wonâ€™t quit shell)

Open the folder containing the shell.c file.Run it in your code editor...or your terminal..it 's pretty much straight forward really.'
